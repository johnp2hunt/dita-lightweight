<p data-hd-class="shortdesc">Testing shows you should network no more than 250 light bulbs to maintain reliable performance.</p>
<p>There is a limit to the number of light bulbs at which the performance of the lighting network begins to decrease. For example, the time it takes a light bulb to respond may start to increase if too many light bulbs are installed on the lighting network. Testing has shown that the lighting network should be limited to a maximum of 250 light bulbs to maintain reliability in performance.</p>
